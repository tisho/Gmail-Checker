Gmail Checker 0.4 by Victor Andr√©e
==================================

This extension will periodically check your Gmail for new e-mails. It also supports
Google apps for your domain. Just enable extensions in Safari 5, install the
extension and configure it under your preferences.

The extension will automatically check the Gmail account that you're currently logged
into. It does not currently support several accounts, nor checking both Gmail and
a custom app mail.

The latest version is always available at [lifefrombelow.com/gmail-checker](http://lifefrombelow.com/gmail-checker) (the
extension should update automatically).

All icons are by Jonathan Shamir.

HTTP Auth bug
-------------

There is one known bug: You may sometimes get an authentication prompt for a "New mail feed".
This is because WebKit doesn't quite follow the XMLHttpRequest spec. You should simply be able
to dismiss this prompt if you see it (it should only appear just when you've logged in or out
of your account).

are however the intellectual property of Jonathan Shamir.
